# WebVR API Extension
Chrome DevTools extension that enables users and developers to run WebVR 1.0 content without having a supported HMD headset or even a compatible browser/platform.
It currently emulates an HTC Vive.

It can also help us to develop even if one owns an HMD, by making repetitive actions that require putting the HMD on and off easier to check through the DevTools panel.

**This extension completely polyfills the WebVR API.
If you have a working WebVR implementation, it will be replaced!**

This is a work in progress in a very early stage.
It can't be turned off except by disabling or removing the extension
